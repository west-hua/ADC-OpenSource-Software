PyMongo 4.8.0
Changes in Version 4.8.0
PyMongo 4.8 brings a number of improvements including:

The handshake metadata for "os.name" on Windows has been simplified to "Windows" to improve import time.
The repr of bson.binary.Binary is now redacted when the subtype is SENSITIVE_SUBTYPE(8).
Secure Software Development Life Cycle automation for release process.
GitHub Releases now include a Software Bill of Materials, and signature
files corresponding to the distribution files released on PyPI.
Fixed a bug in change streams where both startAtOperationTime and resumeToken
could be added to a retry attempt, which caused the retry to fail.
Fallback to stdlib ssl module when pyopenssl import fails with AttributeError.
Improved performance of MongoClient operations, especially when many operations are being run concurrently.
Unavoidable breaking changes
Since we are now using hatch as our build backend, we no longer have a usable setup.py file
and require installation using pip. Attempts to invoke the setup.py file will raise an exception.
Additionally, pip >= 21.3 is now required for editable installs.
Issues Resolved
See the PyMongo 4.8 release notes in JIRA for the list of resolved issues in this release.

PyMongo 4.9.2
Fixed a bug where pymongo.asynchronous.mongo_client.AsyncMongoClient could deadlock.
Fixed a bug where PyMongo could fail to import on Windows if asyncio is misconfigured.
Fixed a bug where pymongo.results.UpdateResult.did_upsert would raise a TypeError.
