Version 1.31.1, 2024-04-01
Move to src style layout, and also for packaging use Hatch rather than setuptools. This means that if the source distribution has a directory added to it (as is needed for packaging for OS distributions) the package can still be built.
Version 1.31.0, 2024-03-31
Now the ssl_context connection parameter can have one of four values:
None - The default, meaning it'll try and connect over SSL but fall back to a plain socket if not.
True - Will try and connect over SSL and fail if not.
False - It'll not try to connect over SSL.
SSLContext object - It'll use this object to connect over SSL.
Version 1.30.5, 2024-02-22
Fix bug that now means the number of parameters cam be as high as an unsigned 16 bit integer will go.
