Paramiko's Changelog: https://www.paramiko.org/changelog.html

3.4.1 2024-08-11
[Bug] #2353: Fix a 64-bit-ism in the test suite so the tests don’t encounter a false negative on 32-bit systems. Reported by Stanislav Levin.
[Bug] #2420: Modify a test-harness skiptest check to work with newer versions of Cryptography. Props to Paul Howarth for the patch.
[Bug] #2419: (fixed in #2421) Massage our import of the TripleDES cipher to support Cryptography >=43; this should prevent CryptographyDeprecationWarning from appearing upon import. Thanks to Erick Alejo for the report and Bryan Banda for the patch.

3.5.0 2024-09-15
[Feature] #982: (via #2444, which was a rebase of #2157) Add support for AES-GCM encryption ciphers (128 and 256 bit variants). Thanks to Alex Gaynor for the report (& for cryptography review), Shen Cheng for the original PR, and Chris Mason for the updated PR; plus as usual to everyone who tested the patches and reported their results!
This functionality has been tested in client mode against OpenSSH 9.0, 9.2, and 9.6, as well as against a number of proprietary appliance SSH servers.

3.5.1 2025-02-03
[Bug] #2490: Private key material is now explicitly ‘unpadded’ during decryption, removing a reliance on some lax OpenSSL behavior & making us compatible with future Cryptography releases. Patch courtesy of Alex Gaynor.

4.0.0 2025-08-03
[Support] #973: Removed support for the DSA (aka DSS) key algorithm, as it has been badly outdated and insecure for a decade or more at this point, and was recently completely removed from OpenSSH as well.
If you were still using DSA out of sheer inertia: we strongly recommend upgrading to Ed25519 (or maybe ECDSA).
If you were still using DSA because of target hosts you do not control: please continue using Paramiko 3.x.
[Support]: Administrivia update:
dropped support for Python <3.9
migrated packaging metadata and practices to use pyproject.toml
removed the now-vestigial ed25519 packaging ‘extra’ (support for this hasn’t required additional dependencies in a number of releases now, just the core ones)
moved Invoke requirement to core dependencies, and removed paramiko[invoke] from extras
with those two changes, paramiko[all] becomes much less useful, and has itself been axed
removed the very old and wizened setup_helper.py which was only needed on ancient (for this century) versions of macOS.
removed paramiko.__all__, as it was redundant (guessing it dated back to some very old Python versions; anyone using import * these days - shame! - should still be fine as we never had any ‘private’ members in __all__ and AFAICT that was the only reason ever to use it in the first place (as import * skips names like _private).
